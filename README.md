Hello!
My name is Anakin and I am a PhD student[^1] at [[**The™** Ohio State University](https://math.osu.edu/people/dey.92)] studying mathematics.
Currently I am interested in both algebraic combinatorics, mostly of an algebro-geometric flavor, computational commutative algebra, and algebraic complexity theory.
On the side, I'm interested in general combinatorial and algebraic topics such as coding theory, cryptography.
I'm also a fan of talking about all things math pedagogy.

However, I do try to make time to do things outside of research and taking classes.
I am attempting to maintain a blog [[commutative.group](https://www.commutative.group/)].
While at UIUC, I founded a math and TCS club [[SIGma](https://www.cstheory.org/)], helped run the cybersecurity club [[SIGPwny](https://sigpwny.com/)], and brewed expensive coffee for the [[Coffee Club](https://www.instagram.com/uiuccoffee/)].
When I'm not talking about those things, I love spending time talking about coffee and motorsports (F1, INDYCAR, WEC, IMSA, FE, you name it).

[^1]: In the spirit of the quote, I'd say I'm currently asking "why do we eat lunch?"
