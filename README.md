Hello! My name is Anakin and I'm a student studying mathematics @ UIUC.
The realm of math I enjoy most is some mixture of abstract algebra, combinatorics, and algorithms.
Currently my primary interests lie in algebraic combinatorics, computational group theory, and computational commutative algebra.
I am also interested in algebraic complexity theory and algebraic coding theory.
When I'm not learning about those things, I love spending time talking about coffee and motorsport (Formula 1, WEC, IMSA, IndyCar, Formula E, NASCAR, GTWC).
